It seems quite a few people who voted to leave the EU are now having second thoughts. Maybe you believed Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage when they [lied about how much money we pay to the EU every month](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/). Or maybe you thought they would honour their [promise to spend that amount on the NHS if they won](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/06/27/brexit_supporters_are_starting_to_regret_350_million_nhs_lie.html). Perhaps, like Michael Gove, you had [had enough of "experts"](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3be49734-29cb-11e6-83e4-abc22d5d108c.html) with their informed opinions, so when those experts [warned that the pound would fall steeply](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/brexit-crash-pound-living-standards-george-soros), or that the hit to the economy could [cost British households up to Â£6,500 per year each](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7d7446c6-ef89-11e5-9f20-c3a047354386.html), you dismissed them as know-it-alls.

*Maybe you're just incredibly embarassed at the existence of Nigel Farage.*

Whatever the reason, now that [the pound is at its lowest level for over 30 years](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pound-sterling-argentine-peso-worst-performing-currency-eu-referendum-brexit-a7127246.html) and [racist attacks are on the rise](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-eu-referendum-racial-racism-abuse-hate-crime-reported-latest-leave-immigration-a7104191.html), you might be wondering what you can do about this flaming shit we've put on our own doorstep. You're not alone. At least 48% of the population of the UK are wondering the same thing.
